- As you go through part 2, make incremental pull requests to resolve the issues youâ€™ve made (ideally 1 pull request per issue)
- Instead of pushing straight to master, create a new branch to push to. 
- Make your changes on this branch.
- Make a pull request from this branch to merge changes back into the main branch. Before you merge the pull request, link this pull request to its corresponding issueLinks to an external site.. 
- Repeat this process for each issue.
